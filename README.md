# Hotel Recommendation for Online Travel Agencies
### Capstone Project
### Cem K?l??l? - JULY, 2017


## Introduction
###Expedia is an online travel agency that offers thousands of properties (hotels, hostels, etc?) all over the world for travelers. With this massive amount of inventory, it is crucial to understand and offer properties which will suit to personal preference of the users. Expedia wants to take user experience to the next level by providing personalized hotel recommendations to their users. Currently Expedia uses search parameters to adjust their recommendations, but there is enough customer specific data to personalize these recommendations for each user. In this project, we have taken up the challenge to contextualize customer data and predict the likelihood a user will stay at 100 different hotel groups.
